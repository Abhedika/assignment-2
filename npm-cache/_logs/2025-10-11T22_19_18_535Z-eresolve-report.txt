# npm resolution error report

While resolving: expensetracker@1.0.0
Found: react@18.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^19.1.0" from react-native@0.81.4
node_modules/react-native
  react-native@"0.81.4" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
